"Valkyrie" finite element solver
=================================
http://anvilofcode.wordpress.com

Overview
---------
"Valkyrie" is a simple API for solving 2D/3D truss structures. A Lua driver script
is offered through which you can solve simple truss structures and print displacements,
stresses, strains, etc. The library can also be used with C/C++.

Version
---------
The current version is 1.0, which is the first release.

Roadmap
---------
version 1.1:    Offer python bindings.
version 1.2:    Use sparse stiffness matrix to handle larger structures.
                Increase allowable maximum number of unknowns.
version 1.3:    Offer better lua/python integration (e.g result iterators, etc)
version 1.4:    Handle nonzero single point constraints.
version 2.0:    Couple with 'revolution' optimizer.

Build
---------
NOTE & WARNING: to build valkyrie, you need to create a directory named 'include' inside your checkout, 
and put there the Eigen library's header. Valkyrie uses Eigen internally as a solver. Boost is also a prerequisite.
If you don't want to mess with building Valkyrie, you can grab binaries at http://anvilofcode.wordpress.com
