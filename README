=================================
http://anvilofcode.wordpress.com

Overview
---------
"Valkyrie" is a simple API for solving 2D/3D truss structures. A Lua driver script
is offered through which you can solve simple truss structures and print displacements,
stresses, strains, etc. The library can also be used with C/C++.

Version
---------
The current version is 1.0b, which is the first beta release.

Roadmap
---------
version 1.1:    Better error handling and diagnostics
version 1.2:    Use sparse stiffness matrix to handle larger structures.
                Increase allowable maximum number of unknowns.
version 1.3:    Offer better lua integration (e.g result iterators, etc)
version 1.4:    Handle nonzero single point constraints.
version 2.0:    Couple with 'revolution' optimizer.
